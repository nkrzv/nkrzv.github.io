You’ll find here my blog and the book I’m writing right now — *The Renegade: A Memoir of a Soviet Cyclist*.

Go to the [Index](https://www.nikolai.com.au/blog) page to see every post on this website sorted by category and the [Book](https://www.nikolai.com.au/book) link will take you to the table of contents for *The Renegade*. The book is live, I publish each chapter as soon as I finish with it.
